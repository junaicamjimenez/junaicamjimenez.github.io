		<h1>Mental health of older adults</h1><br><br><br><br>
		
			
		<img src="../../IMAGES/older5.jpg" type="image/jpg" class="img1"/><br>
		<h2>Risk factors for mental health problems among older adults</h2>
		
		<p>There may be multiple risk factors for mental health problems at any point in life. Older 
		people may experience life stressors common to all people, but also stressors that are 
		more common in later life, like a significant ongoing loss in capacities and a decline in 
		functional ability. For example, older adults may experience reduced mobility, chronic
		 pain, frailty or other health problems, for which they require some form of long-term 
		care. In addition, older people are more likely to experience events such as 
		bereavement, or a drop in socioeconomic status with retirement. All of these stressors 
		can result in isolation, loneliness or psychological distress in older people, for which 
		they may require long-term care.</p><br>
		
		<br><br>
		<img src="../../IMAGES/older8.jpg" type="image/jpg" class="img2"/><br><br>
		<p>Mental health has an impact on physical health and vice versa. For example, older 
		adults with physical health conditions such as heart disease have higher rates of 
		depression than those who are healthy. Additionally, untreated depression in an older 
		a person with heart disease can negatively affect its outcome.</p>
		
		<br><br><br><br><br>
		<img src="../../IMAGES/older7.jpg" type="image/jpg" class="img1"/><br><br>
		<p>Older adults are also vulnerable to elder abuse - including physical, verbal, 
		psychological, financial and sexual abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious losses of 
		dignity and respect. Current evidence suggests that 1 in 6 older people experience elder 
		abuse. Elder abuse can lead not only to physical injuries, but also to serious, sometimes 
		long-lasting psychological consequences, including depression and anxiety.</p>
		
		
		
		<br><br><br><br>
		
		<h2>Treatment and care strategies to address mental health needs of older people</h2>
		<p>It is important to prepare health providers and societies to meet the specific needs of
		older populations, including:</p>
		<ul class="b">
		<li>training for health professionals in providing care for older people;</li>
		<li>preventing and managing age-associated chronic diseases including mental, neurological and substance use disorders;</li>
		<li>designing sustainable policies on long-term and palliative care; and</li>
		<li>developing age-friendly services and settings.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br><br>
		<img src="../../IMAGES/older6.jpg" type="image/jpg" class="img1"/>
		<h2>Health promotion</h2>
		<p>The mental health of older adults can be improved through promoting Active and
		Healthy Ageing. Mental health-specific health promotion for older adults involves
		creating living conditions and environments that support wellbeing and allow people to
		lead a healthy life. </p><br><br><br>
		<ul class="b">
		<p>Promoting mental health depends largely on strategies to ensure 
		that older people have the necessary resources to meet their needs, such as:</p>
		<li>providing security and freedom;</li>
		<li>adequate housing through supportive housing policy;</li>
		<li>social support for older people and their caregivers;</li>
		<li>health and social programmes targeted at vulnerable groups such as those who
		 live alone and rural populations or who
		 suffer from a chronic or relapsing mental
		 or physical illness;</li>
		<li>programmes to prevent and deal with elder abuse; and</li>
		<li>community development programmes.</li>
		</ul>
