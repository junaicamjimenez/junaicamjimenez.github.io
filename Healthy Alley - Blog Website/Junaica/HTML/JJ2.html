			a response to people who have experienced any traumatic event. This can be a car or 
			other serious accident, physical or sexual assault, war-related events or torture, or 
			natural disasters such as bushfires or floods.</p><br>

			People with schizophrenia have a high risk of suicide. Schizophrenia is not a split personality.</p>
